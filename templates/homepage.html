                <p>This project is established towards the fulfilment of my masters degree at the university of
                    Sunderland on a course titled data science product development(CETM46). It is an agricultural data
                    science products that entails the design, development, and management process used in “crop yield
                    prediction”. Crop yield prediction is a difficult task in the field of agriculture and is crucial
                    for decision-making at the local, regional, and global scales. These predictions rely on various
                    factors such as climate, soil, environmental, and crop parameters. Decision support models are
                    widely used in extracting important crop features for prediction. These extractions require the use
                    of sensing technologies, variable rate technologies, management information systems, and responses
                    to variations within and between cropping systems. Machine learning (ML) models were also used after
                    processing agricultural data and Regression models were deployed to predict the yield.

        <h2>Explanation of the Parameters</h2>
        <p> <b>Temperature (Avg):</b>
            High temperature considerably influences the crops by affecting several physiological injuries like leaf
            abscission, leaf scorching, senescence, and root and shoot growth limitation that subsequently leads to a
            reduction in yield. </p>
        <p> <b>Precipitation:</b> It can be defined as earthward falling of water drops or ice particles that have
            formed by
            rapid condensation in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p> <b>Export Quantity:</b>
            Export crops means crops whose majority of production shall be for export outside the State or whose
            majority of the value-added products shall be exported. </p>
        <p> <b>Fertilizer Usage:</b> Most fertilizers that are commonly used in agriculture contain the three basic
            plant
            nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Some fertilizers also contain certain "micronutrients," such
            as zinc and other metals, that are necessary for plant growth.</p>
